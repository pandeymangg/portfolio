        About Me! 👋
      </h2>

      <p className="text-textPrimary text-base md:my-4">
        Hey there! I’m a software engineer with a passion for building intuitive
        user experiences and seamless web applications. Over the years, I've
        enjoyed diving into a wide range of technologies—from JavaScript to C++,
        from frontend UI frameworks like React.js to backend solutions with
        Node.js. My experience spans startups, internships, and a commitment to
        open source, where I've been contributing to an open-source experience
        management solution—an alternative to Typeform.

        This portfolio itself is a reflection of my love for efficient,
        organized design. 🖥️ Inspired by tiling window managers, it's built to
        be minimalistic, modular, and uniquely interactive—just like how I
        approach development: organized, efficient, and a little bit playful. ✨
        <br />
        <br />
        Feel free to explore and open new "windows" to see my work, projects,
        and interests! 🚀
      </p>
